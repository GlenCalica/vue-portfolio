         Iâ€™m a Computer Programming graduate from Seneca College. I'm currently
         focusing on honing my skills on the MERN stack, but I know and have
         used other technologies such as VueJS, WordPress, and Oracle SQL. I've
         also dabbled a bit in web design: using AdobeXD to design apps before I
         start developing them.
